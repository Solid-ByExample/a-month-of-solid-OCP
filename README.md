# Requirements

* Network operations team should be able to extract the body of the message from more than XML.

The list of final supported formats is yet to be determined.

## The Exercise

These new requirements need to be implemented, but also take the chance to abide to the SRP to whatever solution you come up with.

Again, refrain from doing too much and try just appying SRP.

### Hint

What if each format was handled by a different class?

### Hint  #2

Registries are a good way of handling chain of responsibilities.
